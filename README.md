# scroll

Scroll is full-featured IRC bot that carries a **PENIS PUMP** & will brighten up all the mundane chats in your lame IRC channels with some colorful IRC artwork! Designed to be extremely stable, this bot is sure to stay rock hard & handle itself quite well!

All of the IRC art is loaded directly from the [ircart](https://github.com/ircart/ircart) repository, which means anytime that the repository is updated with new art, you can simply `.ascii sync` & then be able to pump the latest art packs!

## Dependencies
* [python](https://www.python.org/)
